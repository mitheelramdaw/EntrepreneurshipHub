### Entrepreneurship Hub:
South Africa has a low number of entrepreneurs. BusinessTech is quoted as saying:

> South Africa has an ‘alarmingly low level of entrepreneurial activity’ in spite of high unemployment, according to a global report.
> The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) report, released by Babson College and Baruch College, surveyed 206,000 individuals and 3,936 national experts on entrepreneurship, across 73 economies.
> GEM participant economies represent 72.4% of the world’s population and 90% of the
world’s GDP.
> In terms of total early-stage entrepreneurial activity (TEA), the report found that a paltry 7% of 18-64 population in SA are starting or running new businesses.
> Only 2.7% of respondents in SA are currently an owner-manager of an established business, i.e., owning and managing a running business that has paid salaries, wages, or any other payments to the owners for more than 42 months.

This web portal aims to help fix that.
